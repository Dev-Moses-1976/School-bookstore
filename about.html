            <p> Bookden website was born out of the growing need to simplify and
                automate bookstore activities, ensuring students can purchase books
                with ease. <br><br>Traditional bookstores often face challenges such as
                overcrowding, long queues, and limited accessibility, leaving students
                struggling to acquire the materials they need without sacrificing
                valuable time. <br><br> Recognizing this, the idea of a web-based system
                emerged as a solution to make book purchases more feasible for
                students.This platform offers a streamlined experience, allowing
                users to browse, select, and purchase textbooks online.<br><br>With features
                like real-time inventory updates, filter functionality and avialability of book description, the website transforms the way
                students access academic resources.
